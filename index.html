            <h1>Get to know SEVENTEEN</h1>
            <p>SEVENTEEN is an idol group, with 13 members and 3 sub-units forming one team.
                By implementing a pre-debut system, SEVENTEEN’s training and debut preparation has been made open to the public through differentiated promotions such as live broadcasts.
                In May 2015, the members finally took their first step in the Korean music industry with their first mini album, ’17 CARAT’, which allowed them to rise as super rookies upon debut. 
                The 3 different sub-units Hip-hop Team, Vocal Team and Performance Team in the group also actively participated in album production.
                In addition, after climbing from locally known super rookies, to ‘self-production idols’ to ‘chyung-ryang-dols’ since their debut, SEVENTEEN has now grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances. </p>
